### CONTEXT

I am a **[DATAVIZ TOOL]** data visualisation developer and looking to **[GOAL]**. 

I want to visualise the topic of **[TOPIC]**, previous examples of visualised shared were showing:
- **[PREVIOUS VIZ EXAMPLE A]**
- **[PREVIOUS VIZ EXAMPLE B]**
- **[PREVIOUS VIZ EXAMPLE C]**

I'm not looking to copy these existing examples, just be aware that readers will be well-versed in the topic, so we are looking for not obvious answers. 

What Audience Looks For:
- Unique angles on the topic.
- Clear and concise visual storytelling.
- Data-driven insights.

Editorial Principles:
- Ensure content is accurate, fair, and impartial.
- Always provide sources for data.
- Graphics should have clearly marked sources, titles, and clear labels on axes.

Guidelines for Data:
- Data should be accurate and up-to-date.
- Avoid using outdated data.
- Provide sources for the data.

### ACTION

We're going to need to work through 3 main topic areas, not potentially in the order provided:

Data:
- I will need to analyse datasets, with an emphasis on the Visual Vocabulary topics: Deviation, Correlation, Change v Time, Ranking, Distribution, Part to whole, Magnitude, Spatial, Flow  
- Where appropriate we should be finding statistically significant differences
- In cases, you may be asked to provide ideas for data and websites where that data can be found

Story:
- I will need to craft a story from the data, ideally, we should be able to say three things about our visualisation at different granularities, i.e. an overall trend, a breakdown by countries in that trend, and the countries changing rank amongst that trend 
- Or a format of what, so what, now what, i.e. China has 80% of the world's gold supply, this is changing the overall price of gold as they can control supply, we need governments to take action (this example is fictional). 
- the reader should be able to have a clear takeaway of what the story is about, something they wouldn't have read from a regular news site.

Visual:
- with reference to the Visual Vocabulary we will need to create an engaging chart.
- the visualisation should work in **[VIZ FORMAT AND SIZE]**
- the empathise of the chart is to help explain the data and the story
- with the visualisation please can you provide a colour scheme and any appropriate font choices

In the end, we will need to check that all three of these elements: Data, Story, and Visual are all working together to tell the same message to our reader.

Don't self-reference or explain yourself unless prompted to do so. Don't write responses as if it's an ad.
