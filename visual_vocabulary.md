### THE VISUAL VOCABULARY

There are so many ways to visualise data – how do we know which one to pick? Below are categories of data relationships, decide which data relationship is most important in your story, then look at the different types of charts within the category to form some initial ideas about what might work best. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, nor a wizard, but is a useful starting point for making informative and meaningful data visualisations

Deviation
- Note this is not standard deviation 
- Emphasise variations (+/-) from a fixed reference point. Typically the reference point is zero but it can also be a target or a long-term average. Can also be used to show sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- Examples of use: Trade surplus/deficit, climate change

Deviation Chart Types:
- bar-diverging: A simple standard bar chart that can handle both negative and positive magnitude values
- bar-diverging-stacked: Perfect for presenting survey results which involve sentiment (eg disagree, neutral, agreed
- spine-chart: Splits a single value into 2 contrasting components (eg Male/Female)
- line-surplus-deficit-filled: The shaded area of these charts allows a balance to be shown; either against a baseline or between two series

Correlation
- Show the relationship between two or more variables. Be mindful that, unless you tell them otherwise, many readers will assume the relationships you show them to be causal (i.e. one causes the other)
- Examples of use: Inflation & unemployment, income & life expectancy

Correlation Chart Types:
- scatterplot: The standard way to show the relationship between two variables, each of which has its own axis
- line-column: A good way of showing the relationship between an amount (columns) and a rate (line)
- scatterplot-connected: Usually used to show how the relationship between 2 variables has changed over time
- Bubble: Like a scatterplot, but adds additional detail by sizing the circles according to a third variable
- XY-heatmap: A good way of showing the patterns between 2 categories of data, less good at showing fine differences in amounts

Change v Time
- Give emphasis to changing trends. These can be short (intra-day) movements or extended series traversing decades or centuries: Choosing the correct time period is important to provide a suitable context for the reader
- Examples of use: Share price movements, economic time series

Change v Time Chart Types:
- line: The standard way to show a changing time series. If data are irregular, consider markers to represent data points
- column-timeline: Columns work well for showing change over time - but usually best with only one series of data at a time
- column-line-timeline: A good way of showing the relationship over time between an amount (columns) and a rate (line)
- stock-price: Usually focused on day-to-day activity, these charts show the opening/closing and high/low points of each day
- slope: Good for showing changing data as long as the data can be simplified into 2 or 3 points without missing a key part of the story
- area: Use with care. These are good at showing changes to the total, but seeing changes in components can be very difficult.
- fan: Use to show the uncertainty in future projections - usually this grows further forward to projection
- scatterplot-line-timeline: A good way of showing changing data for two variables whenever there is a relatively clear pattern of progression. Connected scatterplot
- calendar-heatmap: A great way of showing temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly), at the expense of showing precision in quantity
- priestley timeline: Great when date and duration are key elements of the story in the data
- circles-timeline: Good for showing discrete values of varying size across multiple categories (eg earthquakes by continent)
- seismogram: Another alternative to the circle timeline for showing series where there are big variations in the data

Ranking
- Use where an item’s position in an ordered list is more important than its absolute or relative value. Don’t be afraid to highlight the points of interest.
- Examples of use: Wealth, deprivation, league tables, constituency election results

Ranking Chart Types:
- bar-ordered: Standard bar charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into order
- column-ordered: Standard column charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into order
- symbol-proportional-ordered: Use when there are big variations between values and/or seeing fine differences between data is not so important.
- dot-plot-strip: Dots placed in order on a strip are a space-efficient method of laying out ranks across multiple categories.
- slope: Perfect for showing how ranks have changed over time or vary between categories.
- lollipop-horizontal: Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectively
- lollipop-vertical: Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectively
- bump: Bump charts show a line following the changes in rank over time

Distribution
- Show values in a dataset and how often they occur. The shape (or ‘skew’) of a distribution can be a memorable way of highlighting the lack of uniformity or equality in the data
- Examples of use: Income distribution, population (age/sex) distribution

Distribution Chart Types:
- histogram: The standard way to show a statistical distribution - keep the gaps between columns small to highlight the 'shape' of the data.
- boxplot: Summarise multiple distributions by showing the median (centre) and range of the data
- violin: Similar to a box plot but more effective with complex distributions (data that cannot be summarised with simple average).
- population-pyramids: A standard way for showing the age and sex breakdown of a population distribution; effectively, back-to-back histograms
- dot-plot-strip: Good for showing individual values in the distribution, but can be a problem when too many dots have the same value
- dot-plot: A simple way of showing the range (min/max) of data across multiple categories.
- barcode: Like dot strip plots, good for displaying all the data in a table, they work best when highlighting individual values.
- cumulative-curve: A good way of showing how unequal distribution is: the y-axis is always cumulative frequency, and the x-axis is always a measure.

Part to Whole
- Show how a single entity can be broken down into its component elements. If the reader’s interest is solely in the size of the components, consider a magnitude-type chart instead
- Examples of use: Fiscal budgets, company structures, national election results

Part to Whole Chart Types:
- column-stacked: A simple way of showing part-to-whole relationships but can be difficult to read with more than a few components.
- bar-stacked-proportional: A good way of showing the size and proportion of data at the same time, as long as the data are not too complicated.
- pie: A common way of showing part-to-whole data - but be aware that it's difficult to accurately compare the size of the segments.
- doughnut: Similar to a pie chart - but the centre can be a good way of making space to include more information about the data (eg. total)
- treemap: Use for hierarchical part-to-whole relationships; can be difficult to read when there are many small segments
- Voronoi: A way of turning points into areas - any point within the area is closer to the central point than any other point
- sunburst: Another way of visualising hierarchical part-to-whole relationships. Use sparingly (if at all) for obvious reasons.
- arc: A hemicycle, often used for visualising political results.
- grid plot: Good for showing % information, they work best when used on whole numbers and work well in multiple layout forms.
- Venn: Generally only used for a schematic representation
- Waterfall: This can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.


Magnitude
- Show size comparisons. These can be relative (just being able to see larger/bigger) or absolute (need to see fine differences). Usually, these show a ‘counted’ number (for example, barrels, dollars or people) rather than a calculated rate or per cent
- Examples of use: Commodity production, market capitalisation

Magnitude Chart Types:
- Column: The standard way to compare the size of things. Must always start at 0 on the axis
- Bar: The standard way to compare the size of things. Must always start at 0 on the axis. Good when the data are not time series and labels have long category names
- column-grouped: As per standard column but allows for multiple series. Can become tricky to read with more than 2 series
- bar-grouped: As per standard bar but allows for multiple series. Can become tricky to read with more than 2 series
- bar-stacked-proportional: A good way of showing the size and proportion of data at the same time - as long as the data are not too complicated
- symbol-proportional: Use when there are big variations between values and/or seeing fine differences between data is not so important
- isotope (pictogram): Excellent solution in some instances - use only whole numbers (do not slice off an arm to represent a decimal).
- lollipop-horizontal: Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectively
lollipop-vertical: Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectively
- Radar: A space-efficient way of showing the value of multiple variables - but make sure they are organised in a way that makes sense to the reader.
- Bullet: A bullet graph is a bar marked with extra encodings to show progress towards a goal or performance against a reference line. 
- Parallel coordinates: An alternative to radar charts - again, the arrangement of the variables is important. Usually benefits from highlighting values

Spatial
- Used only when precise locations or geographical patterns in data are more important to the reader than anything else.
- Examples of use: Locator maps, population density, natural resource locations, natural disaster risk/impact, catchment areas, variation in election results

Spatial Chart types:
- basic-choropleth: The standard approach for putting data on a map - should always be rates rather than totals and use a sensible base geography.
- proportional-symbol: Use for totals rather than rates - be wary that small differences in data will be hard to see.
- flow: For showing unambiguous movement across a map
- contour: For showing areas of equal value on a map. Can use deviation colour schemes for showing +/- values
- equalised-cartogram: Converting each unit on a map to a regular and equally-sized shape - good for representing voting regions with equal share.
- scaled-cartogram-value: Stretching and shrinking a map so that each area is sized according to a particular value.
- dot-density: Used to show the location of individual events/locations - make sure to annotate any patterns the reader should see.
- heat-map: Grid-based data values mapped with an intensity colour scale. As choropleth map - but not snapped to an admin/political unit.

Flow
- Show the reader volumes or intensity of movement between two or more states or conditions. These might be logical sequences or geographical locations.
- Example of uses: Movement of funds, trade, migrants, lawsuits, information; relationship graphs

Flow Chart types:
- Sankey: Shows changes in flows from one condition to at least one other; good for tracing the eventual outcome of a complex process
- Waterfall: Designed to show the sequencing of data through a flow
process, typically budgets. Can include +/- components
- Chord: A complex but powerful diagram which can illustrate 2-way flows (and net winner) in a matrix.
- Network: Used for showing the strength and inter-connectedness of relationships of varying types
